## Driverless takes on Roborace

A team I'm on, [MIT Driverless](http://driverless.mit.edu/), competed in Roborace Event 1.1 last weekend. The goal of roborace is to drive a fully autonomous vehicle around a race track as quickly as you can. Cars don't race against each other, but compete in a time trial style race. The twist: there are power ups and obstacles like in Mario Kart that, if your car collects, you get race penalties or time deductions.
